title: "UI composition - the blind spot of distributed systems"
abstract: "When architecting a distributed system, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of all the cloud backend services available to us. Azure Service Bus! AWS Lambda! CosmosDB! We spend a lot of time decoupling all our backend with microservices, each with their own responsibility and stack and so forth, that we often forget: the front-end has to talk to all of these services. But it can be decomposed into components just as easily as the back-end services can."
