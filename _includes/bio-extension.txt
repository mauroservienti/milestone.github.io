When he is not busy with distributed systems he loves to go back to one of his first loves: rich client development using XAML based technologies. Mauro usually writes about technology, but not only, on his English blog at //milestone.topics.it and his Italian blog at //blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics. He is also passionate about skiing, classical dance, and music, in general.
