When he is not busy with distributed systems, he loves to go back to one of his first loves: rich client development using XAML-based technologies. Mauro usually writes about technology, but not only, on his English blog at [//milestone.topics.it](https://milestone.topics.it) and his Italian blog at [//blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics](https://blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics). He is also passionate about race and gravel biking, swimming, classical dance, and music in general.
