When he is not busy with distributed systems, he loves to go back to one of his first loves: rich client development using XAML-based technologies. Mauro usually writes about technology, but not only on his English blog at //milestone.topics.it and his Italian blog at //blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics. He is also passionate about cycling, swimming, classical dance, and music (and skiing in a previous life).
