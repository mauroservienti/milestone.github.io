When he is not busy with distributed systems, he loves to go back to one of his first loves: rich client development using XAML-based technologies. Mauro usually writes about technology, but not only, on his English blog at <a href="https://milestone.topics.it" target="_blank">//milestone.topics.it</a> and his Italian blog at <a href="http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics" target="_blank">//blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics</a>. He is also passionate about race and gravel biking, swimming, classical dance, and music in general.
