When my 5-year-old iPad Pro fell on the floor for the third time (not accidentally, one could argue when you have a 5-year-old kid. Coincidence? I don't think so!), I decided it was time for a new iPad rather than spending a lot to fix it due to an expired warranty.

I bought a new iPad Air with the M1 CPU and a Magic Keyboard. No pencil, I still have the first-generation Apple Pencil, and I need to find out where it is, given that I never really used it.

The main idea that justifies spending a ton of money on the keyboard is:

> Given how superb [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://milestone.topics.it/2021/06/11/visual-studio-code-remote-containers.html) support is, the option to use it from a browser through [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [GitHub Dev](https://github.com/github/dev), and the recently introduced support for [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/12/07/remote-even-better)

I would like to know if I can use an iPad as an on-the-go development/work device.

## Specs

There are a few options when buying an iPad. I went for the Air M1 one, with 256 GB of storage and a SIM card.

## The good and the not so good

### Connectivity

Let's start with the latter. SIM card support is beneficial. I have a data plan, and not being required to tether using the phone is a plus. It saves the phone's battery life.

### Portability

Portability is excellent, and battery life is superb.

My main concern is that the device with the keyboard is too heavy. According to my kitchen scale, it's 464 + 602 grams. A little more than a kilogram is not a big deal, but it feels too much for what's still an iPad.

### Screen

For prolonged periods of usage, the screen is too small. 10" is great for specific tasks, and coding is not among them.

### Keyboard and trackpad

The lack of the escape key drives me nuts. Muscle memory kicks in too quicklyâ€”every single time!

The trackpad is small but freaking good.

The great thing is that keyboard shortcuts and trackpad behaviors are what I'm used to as a macOS user.

## Conclusion

If it's your only option, then a 10 inches iPad can be used as a development machine. Otherwise, a bigger screen is beneficial, if not mandatory. Everything else works fine, making me think that a MacBook Air is a better compromise.
