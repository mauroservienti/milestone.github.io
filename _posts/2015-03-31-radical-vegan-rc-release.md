We have just released ([also on NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/radical)) the RC version of [Radical](https://github.com/RadicalFx/Radical) “Vegan”, closed issues: https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues?q=milestone%3AVegan+is%3Aclosed

### Highlights

* [Default conventions support](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues/104): simplifies how the user replaces/overrides conventions;
* A [nasty MessageBroker bug](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues/108) related to thread safety;
* A [container memory leak](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues/126) that in some scenario caused some headaches (actually fixed only for Castle Windsor, others are on the way);
* [Universal Apps](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical-universal) support;
* Some documentation improvements;

It is a release candidate so use it, it is supported, stay tuned and [report any issue](https://github.com/RadicalFx/radical/issues) you may encounter.
