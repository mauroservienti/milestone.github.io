It’s surprising how time flies. I wrote [my first blog article](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics/archive/2004/11/30/6360.aspx) in Italian 20 years ago today.

I’ve been quiet over the last few months. We moved to a new house, which absorbed most of my free time. I have plenty of topics to write about, not for twenty more years, yet ;-)
