It’s surprising how time flies. I wrote [my first blog article](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics/archive/2004/11/30/6360.aspx) in Italian 20 years ago today. Over the years, before joining [Particular Software](https://particular.net/) and mostly to challenge myself, I started [blogging in English](https://milestone.topics.it/2011/09/c-typeloaderinterceptor.html) on blogger.com. I kinda liked it ;-)

The Italian blog and the English one were later merged into this one.

Today, this article is number 844. This brings me to an average of 42 articles a year, more or less one every week, excluding vacation. I cannot really complain :-)

I’ve been quiet over the last few months. We moved to a new house, which absorbed most of my free time. I have plenty of topics to write about, not for twenty more years, yet ;-)
