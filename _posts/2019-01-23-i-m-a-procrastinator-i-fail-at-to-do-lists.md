title: "I'm a procrastinator. I fail at To-Do lists."
author: Mauro Servienti
synopsis: "I tried to-do lists many many times, and after a while I always failed. Being a procrastinator doesn't really help when it comes to to-do lists. Here is my reasoning on the root causes of the problem and how I decided to fix it."

One of the things that probably passed under the radar in my last post, [Once upon a time...](/2019/01/16/once-upon-a-time.html), is the following statement:

> **Set a schedule**, sit down and write. **Set a schedule, a time slot**, sit down and write.

(emphasis is mine)

## My to-do lists are words in the wind

It's a strong statement, I know. Let me elaborate on that.

I run my day with to-do lists, religiously, for more than 2 years. The routine was something like:

* Define what you want to do, today
* Check all the done items
* At the end of the day:
  * run a short retrospective
  * copy leftovers to the day after

After a year or so, I added a sort of prioritization:

* At the beginning of the day select the 4 most important things and work on those first.

### I failed :-)

It never worked out very well, some days were literally awesome, but the majority were still a nightmare. Here is why:

#### I'm a procrastinator

I'm very good at convincing myself that something can be done later and that there are more important things to do now. You know, things like watching [TOP 10 Awesome Lego Creations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKU8eYJlUU) on YouTube. Being a procrastinator makes it very hard to stick to a plan that is not really a plan, but more a suggestion.

#### Estimates are the root of many evils

"Define what you want to do, today" combined "At the beginning of the day select the 4 most important things and work on those first." starts from the assumption that it's reasonable to predict that those 4 things can be done in a day. If most of the times that turns to be wrong, your to-do list becomes a sort of constantly forward sliding window.

#### Context matters

The way we are set up in [Particular Software](https://particular.net/blog/an-organization-deconstructed) makes it a little bit more complex to predict in advance how your day will be, making a relaxed, and to-do lists based, unplanned day a kind of wounded territory for disruptions. Many things might happen that drag you away from your original to-do list for the day. And this in combination with being a procrastinator is a recipe for a productivity disaster.

### Poor satisfaction

All this can only lead to poor satisfaction: you reach the end of the day, look back at your to-do list to find out that:

* the original plan, mostly, failed
* there are many more things on the list than at the beginning of the day
* most of them are not checked, so they'll simply clutter your tomorrow

## Short term planning changed my day

I'm now experimenting, with success so far, a different way of organizing my week. Yes, the whole week. It's a combination of careful planning, relaxed planning and to-do lists. Plus a little bit of refactoring.

### To-do lists

I turned my to-do list into a simple backlog, I'll add all the things I want or I need to do. This is it, no priorities, no estimates, nothing. Just a flat list of things that sooner or later needs to be done.

### Careful planning

Every Friday morning I spend ~45 minutes planning next week:

* I'll go through my backlog, and based on various factors, I decided what I'll work on next week
* the lucky backlog items will find a spot on my calendar

Finding a spot on a calendar implies a rough estimate of the work required to get the thing done. My rule of thumb is: make it so that it's not longer than 1 hour. If it is: split the work into multiple backlog items and re-plan.

The end goal is to fill the first 2 and a half days of the week, from Monday to Wednesday at lunch time. All the scheduled slots are set as `busy`.

### Relaxed planning

It doesn't end here. On Fridays I also plan the rest of the week, from Wednesday afternoon to end of Friday. The difference is that all the scheduled slots are set as `free`. This means that whoever tries to schedule something with me can hardly find a spot till Wednesday morning, but will see the rest of the week as free.

### Consolidation

On Wednesdays morning I finally consolidate the rest of the week, turning what were `free` slots to `busy`, and adjusting or changing what needs intervention (refactoring).

## Planning for the unplanned

Everyday there is one slot, sometime during the day, defined as `Inbox triage & TODOs`. It basically serves two purposes:

* Groom my backlog by looking and new things that are coming through my inbox, whatever inbox means (we'll talk about that in a future post)
* Act like a buffer to absorb wrong estimates.

Buffer consumption is what's happening right now with this post. It was planned for this morning, last slot before lunch time. Due to a meeting that went late in the first slot in the morning, the whole morning has been pushed back by 30 minutes. The `Inbox triage & TODOs` is now giving away for "free" 30 minutes to allow me to:

* finish the post
* make so that morning delay doesn't affect the afternoon

### What about emergencies then?

They don't exist, I'm sorry. _Your_ emergencies are not allowed to disrupt _my_ day. In [Particular](https://particular.net/) we have a clearly defined process to handle them. This is the On Call schedule. And this the way to handle things when the roof is on fire. Everything else can wait 2 days. If something that needs attention happens on Monday afternoon, it can easily wait till Wednesday afternoon. Otherwise it means that we have a much bigger problem than the emergency itself. This is another story, though, that deserves it's own post.
