title: "All our aggregates are wrong"
synopsis: "It always starts well. At first glance the requirements seem straightforward, and implementation proceeds without hiccups. Then the requirements start to get more complex, and you find yourself in a predicament, introducing technical shortcuts that smell for the sake of delivering the new feature on schedule. In this talk, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. We'll then go ahead and add a few more use-cases that make it more complex and see how it can negatively impact the overall design. Finally, we'll focus our attention to the business needs of these requirements and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing the feature. Walk away with a new understanding on how to take requirements apart to build the right software."

## All our aggregates are wrong

> Business requirements are seldom as simple as they seem. What happens when the requirements start to get more complex than your original design? Will you be able to adapt?

It always starts well. At first glance the requirements seem straightforward, and implementation proceeds without hiccups. Then the requirements start to get more complex, and you find yourself in a predicament, introducing technical shortcuts that smell for the sake of delivering the new feature on schedule. In this talk, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. We'll then go ahead and add a few more use-cases that make it more complex and see how it can negatively impact the overall design. Finally, we'll focus our attention to the business needs of these requirements and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing the feature. Walk away with a new understanding on how to take requirements apart to build the right software.

## Tutti i nostri aggregati sono sbagliati

Inizia sempre tutto bene, il requisito è semplice e l'implementazione procede senza intoppi. Poi i requisiti aumentano e ci ritroviamo con una strana sensazione allo stomaco e con la necessità di introdurre alchimie tecnologiche che non ci piacciono, ma non sappiamo perché. Prenderemo una funzionalità tanto semplice, quanto usata, come il carrello di un e-commerce e proveremo a capire se è veramente così semplice. Guarderemo il problema tecnico che vogliamo risolvere e poi sposteremo l'attenzione sui requisiti di business. Requisiti che una volta compresi a fondo ci porteranno a capire quali sono le vere responsabilità del dominio.
