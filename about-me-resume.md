## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Solution Architect at Particular Software with extensive expertise in distributed systems, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and message-based architectures. Former Microsoft MVP (2006-2016) with 20+ years of experience helping developers build better .NET systems. Internationally recognized technical speaker and open-source contributor specializing in microservices, UI composition, and messaging patterns.

### Remote Work Excellence

With over a decade of remote work experience at Particular Software, a fully distributed organization where every team member works from a different location worldwide, I have mastered the art of effective remote collaboration. My role as a Solution Architect requires seamless coordination across multiple time zones, cultures, and continents—skills I've honed through years of delivering workshops, conducting customer consultations, and collaborating with distributed development teams.

Working remotely has been more than just a logistical arrangement; it's been a testament to self-discipline, clear communication, and proactive engagement. I've established dedicated workspace practices, including maintaining a separate home office to ensure professional focus and work-life balance. This approach has enabled me to consistently deliver high-quality technical guidance, create educational content, and speak at international conferences while managing complex architectural projects.

My experience with distributed systems architecture has a natural parallel with distributed team collaboration—both require clear boundaries, well-defined interfaces, and asynchronous communication patterns. I've successfully navigated the challenges of remote work, from facilitating virtual workshops and webinars to mentoring team members through remote coaching sessions, proving that geographical distance is no barrier to building strong professional relationships and delivering exceptional results.

Whether collaborating on open-source projects on GitHub, conducting technical reviews, or providing customer support across continents, I bring the same rigor and commitment to remote work that I apply to architecting resilient distributed systems.

### Mastering Self-Organization: A Systematic Approach to Getting Things Done

My approach to productivity follows a simple principle: "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast." Rather than rushing, I focus on building sustainable habits and systems that free my mind for complex problem-solving.

I'm a firm believer in checklists and templates. As I often say, "I'm lazy—I have a checklist for everything." By offloading routine processes to well-designed workflows (using tools like Todoist and Dropbox Paper), I preserve mental bandwidth for architectural challenges and creative work. Whether preparing for international travel, deploying to production, or managing daily responsibilities, template-based systems ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

My methodology emphasizes continuous improvement through data collection and reflection. I regularly analyze time usage, identify inefficiencies, and refine processes—documenting this evolution in my "Lifehacking 101" blog series, where I've openly shared struggles with procrastination and the practical solutions I've developed.

The key insight: effective organization isn't about doing more things faster—it's about mastering fundamentals until they become automatic. This approach enables me to manage complex projects, coordinate across time zones in a distributed organization, and deliver consistent results without burnout. I embrace the journey over the destination, maintaining sustainable productivity while preserving energy for the next challenge.
