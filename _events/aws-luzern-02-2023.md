- title: "An AWS journey from SQS and SNS to architecture...and back"
  abstract: "Unnecessary coupling brings every distributed system to a grinding halt. A great way to decouple services is to use messages exchanged over queues instead of HTTP. AWS offers at least two prominent options for messaging, SQS and SNS, which have some overlap. After this talk, you will understand the difference between SQS and SNS, and when and how to use them. You'll learn how messaging has the potential to shape your systems in powerful ways, not only with AWS. Join me for valuable lessons to stop fearing about coupling - all with examples in C#."
