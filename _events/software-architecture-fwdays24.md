## Choreography. The microservices ballet

We’ve been using distributed transactions for decades. However, the advent of the cloud posed a critical design challenge: no more distributed transactions.

How do we design a complex software system made of several components interacting with each other and in apparent need of coordination? It seems that some form of orchestration is mandatory. However, that comes with coupling.

Not all hope is lost. Join Mauro and see how we can design complex systems using choreography techniques to reduce coupling, avoid using distributed transactions, and, still, satisfy business needs.
