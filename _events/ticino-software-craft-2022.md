- title: "Amazon SQS and SNS for .NET developers"
  abstract: "One of the mantras of distributed systems is decoupling. A great way to decouple applications or parts of a single application is to use a queue to exchange messages. AWS offers two options, SQS and SNS, which apparently have a lot in common.
We will analyze why to use a queue, we will understand what SQS and SNS are, and when to use one, the other, or both. All with examples in C#."
